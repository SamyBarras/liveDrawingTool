## Usage

Always keep "data" directory attached to the app (in the same directory).

Double clic on "LiveDrawingTool" app to launch it.
All infos and help on shortcuts will be displayed by default. If not, press "h".

Use keyboard shortcuts to move from a layer to another.
Then draw ! :)

There are several options to update presets :
- Pen's size and eraser's size for each preset can be updated directly within the app (using keyboard shortcuts)
- Preset's name, pen's color, keyboard shortcut, MIDI shortcut, have to be modified directly in JSON file ("data/presets.json")
